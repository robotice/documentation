Adafruit FT232H - USB to GPIO/SPI/I2C
=====================================

This chip from FTDI is similar to their USB to serial converter chips but adds a 'multi-protocol synchronous serial engine' which allows it to speak many common protocols like SPI, I²C, serial UART, JTAG, and more!  There's even a handful of digital GPIO pins that you can read and write to do things like flash LEDs, read switches or buttons, and more.

UMFT201XB - USB to GPIO/SPI/I2C
===============================

The UMFT201XB bridges from USB to I²C two-wire serial bus interface. The UMFT220XB bridges from USB to Parallel 4-Bit FT1248 Interface. The UMFT230XB bridges from USB to Basic UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter). The breakout board converts USB 2.0 Full-Speed to a serial interface. Serial signals on a 2.54mm (0.1) pitch 10-pin female connector.

The module plug directly into the USB host connector and the pads of the PCB makes electrical contact with the electrical contacts of the USB connector. The serial interface operate at +3.3V. Input/Output pins are 5V tolerant.
