Robotice Project
================

Robotice is autonomous agent-based system aimed to solve common life problems.

* ICT Service Monitoring - React to hardware and load problems by integration with opensource monitoring and configuration management frameworks.
* Security and survailance - Interact with cameras to capture and evaluate the data for alarms or other actions.
* Gardening Automation - Integrate various hardware sensors and actuators to support gardening automation.
